Below are the IPC mechansims which is used to communciate between the process,



Thread:

1) Threads has its own stack containing local variable and function call information
2) Threads share data area and heap section.
3) Threads can communicate with each other via global variablses that they share.
4) The threading API provides condition variables and mutexes, which are primitives that enables the threads of a process to communciate and syncronise their actions.
5) The primary advantages of using threads are that they make it easy to share data (via global variables) between cooperating threads and that some algorithms transpose more naturally to a multithreaded implementation than to a multiprocess implementation.
6)
